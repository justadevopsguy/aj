      <p>
        For more than a year now my girlfriend (Gwe üê•) kept on complaining about how <a href="http://gwenduling.com"
          target="_blank">her website</a> is deployed only on a free
        serverless hosting that she figured out all on her own (it was already live before I met her). The application
        oftens
        become unreachable and the things she can do with it was only limited because it's free.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other than a paid hosting, she also wanted a dedicated server. Why? She recently implemented a <strong>server
          side
          rendering</strong> for her
        <strong>client side</strong>
        Angular website. Basically she has a single page application that she wants Google (and others) to treat as if
        they
        are really in separate pages. Since it is currently serverless, she has to prerender the server HTML files
        manually
        in her local setup every
        time she posts
        a new blog post, and then upload
        it in the file manager where her site was hosted ü•µ. These annoying but important steps are going to be
        eliminated
        by the server.
      </p>

      <p>
        What delayed me with working on this is the fact that I know she doesn't just need better and paid services, she
        will also
        want me to automate her processes <strong>(git push ‚Üí build ‚Üí deploy)</strong> so that we can replicate the
        workflow
        she is used to
        at work. We are both employed
        in
        the same company, current and the one before ü§™ so we already know how we both want out workflow to be.
      </p>

      <p>The next issue then is time and we finally
        had some free time (and productivity) during our 2020
        holiday break.</p>

      <h2>Planning phase...</h2>
      <p>I summarized her requirements (problems) and they are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>More powerful hosting to minimize downtime</li>
        <li>Dedicated server for Angular Universal</li>
        <li>Automation to build and deploy her app</li>
        <li>Remove the unsecured icon in the URL bar (if possible)</li>
        <li>CDN for her blog images going forward</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Her requirements seemed so simple at first glance. It was not until I tried to dig deeper that I understood
        that
        they are a lot and this is not going to be a simple project.</p>
      <p>
        I then analyzed what options are best for what was needed. I updated her requirements into questions that
        helped me conceptualize it better.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>What is the maximum budget allowed?</li>
        <li>What is the best CI and CD to use?</li>
        <li>Is it better to containerized her application?</li>
        <li>Should I enable TLS/SSL on the website even though it has no transactions?</li>
        <li>What is the best cloud provider to use?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Is it a good idea to migrate the domain from GoDaddy to the new cloud provider?</li>
        </ul>
        <li>What is the best DNS service to use?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Execution Phase...</h2>
      <p>After thorough evaluation of the requirements and available solutions, I ended up using <a
          href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a> as cloud provider
        among other things. Why?</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ease of use.</strong> As compared to other cloud providers I have tried.</li>
        <li><strong>Lot‚Äôs of free services.</strong> Check their <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/"
            target="_blank">Free
            Tier</a>! </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pay-As-You-Go pricing.</strong> I predict that most of the services are going to be used (abused) only
          in
          the beginning as I set it up. After that and if it runs smoothly, the services won't be used as much which
          makes
          the pay-as-you-go pricing ideal in this situation.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Technologies used:</h2>
      <h3>
        üëâüèº Docker
      </h3>
      <p>
        I decided to containerized the application to easily deploy the application whenever I want.
      </p>
      <h3>
        üëâüèº CI/CD (AWS CodePipeline)
      </h3>
      <p>The good thing about this is that it is a Pipeline, meaning you can configure or setup the workflow that you
        desire. Here's how I configured the application:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Source</strong>: check out the repository from GitHub
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Build and Test</strong>: build the Angular application using AWS CodeBuild. To
          easily track my build commands I created the <strong>buildspec.yml</strong> a spec file that is supported by
          CodeBuild
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Deploy</strong>: if build is successful it would automatically deploy to <a
            href="https://gwenduling.com" target="_blank">gwenduling.com</a>. This
          stage calls the AWS CodeDeploy to communicate with my EC2 instance.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>
        üëâüèº Reverse Proxy (NGINX)
      </h3>

      <p>
        I have 2 options here; I could either use NGINX to proxy the application or use AWS Load Balancer to make the
        application accessible.
        After weighing my use case, I decided to just go with NGINX for now since NGINX is
        configurable meaning I have more freedom to play around if I want to test something new.
      </p>
      <h3>
        üëâüèº TLS/SSL (Let‚Äôs Encrypt)
      </h3>
      <p>By default, most of websites are deployed using HTTP. HTTPS comes in if you want to indicate that your website
        is
        secure. The technology that powers the additional ‚Äú<strong>S</strong>‚Äù is the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). When
        to
        use SSL? If you have a sensitive information that needs to be secured.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before migrating it to AWS, the application uses only HTTP but when I migrated it on AWS, I added the SSL even
        though
        there‚Äôs no sensitive information in it as it just a blog. I still decided on using Let's Encrypt to generate
        free
        trusted
        certificates because it's free anyway and the additional load time won't make a big difference since it's a
        lightweight application.
      </p>

      <h3>
        üëâüèº DNS Service (Route 53)
      </h3>
      <p>The application is a paid domain, it was bought from GoDaddy. Rather than transferring the ownership to AWS
        Route53, I decided to just change the Name Servers on Godaddy to Point it on the AWS Route53
        nameservers. This way, the new application that is deployed on AWS would be able to use the current domain.
      </p>

      <h2>
        What's next?
      </h2>
      <p>
        After the success of our side project, it is now my turn to have a website of my own. The hardest part with
        portolios and personal website has always been content, so now that the problem is solved (with this blog post),
        we
        pushed through and here we are! <i>(Let's talk about some other time how awesome it is to work with my
          girlfriend
          despite the fact that companies frown upon it!)</i>
      </p>
      <p>As a challenge to myself I'll be using different technologies this time. And I'll blog about it again.</p>

      <p>And that's it! Thank you for reading my first blog!!!</p>
